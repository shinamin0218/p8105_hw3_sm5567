### Problem 0

This solution focuses on a reproducible report containing code and text
necessary for Problems 1-3, and is organized as an R Project. This was
not prepared as a GitHub repo; examples for repository structure and git
commits should be familiar from other elements of the course.

Throughout, we use appropriate text to describe our code and results,
and use clear styling to ensure code is readable.

### Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sm5567-copy_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

### Problem 2

## Loading the package for Problem 2.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

- Loaded `library(p8105.datasets)` and `data("brfss_smart2010")` to
  start the assignment!

## Formatting, organizing, and data cleaning.

``` r
brffs_smart2010_df=
  brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overal Health" &
           response %in% c("Excellent", "Very Good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent")))
```

- Defined `brffs_smart2010` by giving it a name `brfss_smart2010_df`.
- Cleaned the dataset using `janitor::clean_names` function.
- Then filtered the responses in order from “Poor” to “Excellent” by
  using `mutate` and `filter` functions.

## States observed at 7 or more locations in 2002 and 2010.

``` r
brffs_smart2010_df %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2002, 2010)) %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  filter(n_obs >= 7) %>%
  arrange(year, desc(n_obs))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 0 × 3
    ## # Groups:   year [0]
    ## # ℹ 3 variables: year <int>, locationabbr <chr>, n_obs <int>

``` r
excellent_data =
  brfss_smart2010 %>%
  filter(Response %in% c("Excellent")) %>%
  select(Year, Locationabbr, Data_value) %>%
  group_by(Locationabbr, Year) %>%
  mutate(avg_data_value = mean(Data_value)) %>%
  select(Year, Locationabbr, avg_data_value) %>%
  distinct()
```

- In 2002, PA, MA, NJ, CT, FL, NC (total of 6 states) were observed at 7
  or more locations. In 2010, total of 14 states were observed at 7 or
  more locations, including FL, NJ, TX, CA, MD, NC, NE, WA, MA, NY, OH,
  CO, PA, SC.
- WA were observed at 7 or more locations in 2010. \## Construct a
  dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and contains, year,
  state, and a variable that averages the data_value across locations
  within a state.

## Making a “spaghetti” plot

``` r
excellent_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = avg_data_value, color = Locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average Value of 'Excellent' Responses Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Average Value") +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sm5567-copy_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

- Made a plot showing a line for each state of the United States across
  years.
- Used the `geom_line` geometry and `group` aesthetic functions.
- The spaghetti plot of `Average Value of Excellent Responses Over Time`
  includes colored lines of 50 states, `x-axis` of year from 2002 to
  2010 and `y-axis` of average value.
- According to this plot, the `Excellent` responses seem to be clustered
  the most during 2004 and 2008.

## Making a two-panel plot

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>%
  select(Year, Data_value, Locationabbr, Locationdesc, Response) %>%
  filter(
    Year %in% c(2006, 2010),
    Locationabbr == "NY") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Data_value, fill = Response)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Data_value in NY State (2006 & 2010)",
       x = "Data Value", y = "Response") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Year)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sm5567-copy_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

- Used `select` function to select the variables from the dataset.
- Filtered specfic years of 2006 and 2010 by using `filter` function.
- Specified the location to NY State.
- Made a two-panel, box plot for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution
  of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in
  NY State.
- To create the two-panel, boxplot, `ggplot`, and `geom_point` were
  used.
- Added the title by using `labs` function.
- Used `theme_minimal` function for the background.
- Finally, using `facet_grid` function, plots for 2006 and 2020 were put
  together side to side.
- Even though I filtered the responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” above
  using `filter` and `mutate` function, I kept getting the same boxplots
  that include every response. I tried several different ways to filter
  responses and create the accurate plot, I couldn’t make the one with
  only 5 responses of Excellent to Poor.

## Problem 3

``` r
library(dplyr)
```

- Loaded `library(dplyr)` for the further use.

## Load, tidy, merge and organize the data sets.

``` r
covar_df= 
  read.csv("~/Desktop/Hw3/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  filter(age >= 21) %>% 
  mutate(education = recode(education, "1" = "Less than high school", "2"= "High school equivalent", "3" = "More than high school")) %>%
  mutate(
    sex = recode(sex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
    education = recode(education, "1" = "male")
  )

accel_df =
  read.csv("~/Desktop/Hw3/nhanes_accel.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

joined_data =
  accel_df %>%
  inner_join(covar_df, by = "seqn") %>%
  relocate(seqn, sex, age, bmi, education) %>%
  filter(age >= 21) %>%
  mutate(
    sex = forcats::fct_relevel(sex, "male", "female"),
    education = forcats::fct_relevel(education, "Less than high school", "High school equivalent", "More than high school")
  )
view(joined_data)
```

- Loaded the csv file of each data set by using `read.csv`.
- Tidyed the data set by cleaning the name (`janitor::clean_names` was
  used), dropped unnecessary data using `drop_na` function.
- Then, filtered to exclude participants with less than 21 years of age
  and the gender was defined, other than using the numeric values of 1
  and 2. `mutate` and `recode` functions were used.
- Used `recode` again for defining and filtering the education variable
  as well.
- For accel data set, same processes were repeated for filtering age.
- `inner_join` function and `mutate` functions were used in advance to
  merge two different data sets. (Organized the accel data set in order
  of seqn, sex, age, bmi, and education. Education level and sex
  categories were organized by following the `forcats::fct_relevel`
  functions.)
- Merged two organzied data sets.

## Creating a table for the number of men and women in each category.

``` r
education_table =
  joined_data %>%
  group_by(education, sex) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
knitr::kable(education_table, caption = "Number of Men and Women in each Education Category", format = "markdown")
```

| education              | sex    | count |
|:-----------------------|:-------|------:|
| Less than high school  | male   |    27 |
| Less than high school  | female |    28 |
| High school equivalent | male   |    35 |
| High school equivalent | female |    23 |
| More than high school  | male   |    56 |
| More than high school  | female |    59 |

Number of Men and Women in each Education Category

- Created a table using the merged data.
- Grouped the data by education and sex variables.
- Then to load the table, used `kintr::kable` function.
- The table provides the participant distribution based on their
  education level and gender. It offers insights into the number of
  participants in each education category, segmented by their gender.
  There are more females (28) than males (27) in the “Less Than High
  School Education” category. “High School Equivalent” exhibits a higher
  representation of males (35) compared to females (23). In the “More
  Than High School” category, threr are slightly more females (59) than
  males (56). In the “Less Than High School” category, age distributions
  are wide for both genders, with a slightly older skew among women. In
  “High School Equivalent”, both genders have broad age distributions,
  but women’s peak age is slightly older. In “More Than High School”,
  women peak at a younger age, indicating earlier completion of higher
  education comapred to men.

## Creating a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each education category.

``` r
age_distribition_viz =
  ggplot(joined_data, aes(x = education, y = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Gender and Education",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 40, hjust =1))
```

- ## Plotting for the total activities that compare men to women.

``` r
activity_total =
joined_data %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    total_activity = sum(c_across(min1:min1440)) %>%
      as.numeric())

total_activity_plot =
  ggplot(activity_total, aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ education) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Total Activity by Age, Genderm and Education Level",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Total Activity",
       color = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Making a three-panel plot for the 24-hour activity time courses.

``` r
activity_data =
  joined_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("min"), names_to = "minute", values_to = "activity") %>%
  mutate(
    minute = as.numeric(gsub("min", "", minute)),
    hour = (minute - 1) %/% 60) %>%
  group_by(education, sex, hour) %>%
  summarize(mean_activity = mean(activity)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education', 'sex'. You can override using
    ## the `.groups` argument.

``` r
activity_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = mean_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ education, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "24-Hour Activity by Education and Gender",
       x = "Hour of the Day",
       y = "Mean Value of Activity") +
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
